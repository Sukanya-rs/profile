 Welcome to my github page! (Work in progress)

 <summary>Summary of my work profile</summary>
        
        I am Sukanya. Currently working as a Technical Writer and Communition Navigator at OpenMined, while I am  
        learning to code in python & also trying to understand the codebase of PySyft. I have experience as Industrial 
        service line engineer and moved to becoming a Senior Network Engineer and now exploring AI to understand 
        it's impact on privacy & security!, while trying to explore opportunities to learn how to build things 
        that can create value using AI. 
 
        My work profile has multiple skills that I have gained over period of ~8 years.  My First role was as a  
        Industrial service line engineer(Planner-III) worked for 2 years in Hewlett packard, i have optimized 
        mulitple complex service process (Retail, Global financial accounting, Hewlett packard financial services) 
        and systems of scale of ~300 people working with 100's of application used in these process which was based on ILO 
        standards. End product of my work was to define metrics & optimizing these metrics such that value is generated out of 3P's (people, process and 
        product),while also monitoring the productivity and efficiency. I have created value engineering maps identifying value generation using 
        the existing processes and if it was financial process have worked to ensure it meets SOX compliance. 
 
        Have collaborated with business process management teams (IT / Training / Finance / Operations /HR) to lead 
        projects that identify process changes and consult on change control process mechanisms.

        My main challenge here was to optimize research work in these processes, which made me to think 
        differently and shift to Information technology as I found to optimize better it is important to know how 
        the background network of applications which choose me to become a network engineer. Issues like slowing down of applications, security issues, the 
        way employees of the processes defined explaining about issues with design of applications made me kindle my desire to learn about how networks 
        work and always wanted to learn to code applications. 
 
        As I choose to become a network engineer and learn the skills. I choose to teach in Internetworkz and share want I 
        learnt. Took CCNA, CCNP and CCIE writing exams and as well as worked in JPMorgan as a Technical Support Engineer. My Journey to work more on this 
        field lead me to work with CCS Corp- Juniper networks. I have worked as a Tier1/Tier2 Senior Network engineer for M, MX and T series routers 
        that could be deployed as core, IP edge or as even a switch depending on type of configuration of the 
        router supporting JunosOS and hence gained knowledge of core network , tunneling, authentication, 
        authorisation, accounting, firewall,security, load balancing, VPN, MPLS, SDN, certification authority 
        servers, network module management, Quality of service, url filtering, Network admission control, etc 
        concepts along with grasping how each customer networks backbone architecture work. 

        I moved to Ericsson - Bangalore as Tier3 network engineer part of network services, which is the last point of  
        resolution working on Ericsson edge/core network devices providing carrier grade services providing support 
        to major telecoms like Sprint, AT&T, Telefonica, Airtel, Vodafone and many more. Apart from the regular 
        packet core network, supported broadband subscription, Mobile backbone network(4G LTE), LTE-advanced, IPTV 
        and collaborating with OSS/BSS for network monitoring. Working in Ericsson- Germany gave me exposure to not just work on the technical issues but 
        to explore into researching the issues for major Red Alert Issues and identifying the root cause among many related issues. I find this type of
        research issues more valuable since it gives you freedom to explore the root cause to fix the issue, while interacting with the major telecom 
        customers in real time.
