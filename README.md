<summary>**Detailed Profile**</summary>

I am Sukanya. Currently a Technical Writer and Communition Navigator at OpenMined, while I am learning to code in python. I have experience as Industrial service line engineer and moved to becoming a Senior Network Engineer. 
 
 My work profile has multiple skills that I have gained over period of ~8 years.  My First role was as a Industrial service line engineer(Planner-III) worked for 2 years in Hewlett packard, i have optimized mulitple complex service process (Retail, Global financial accounting, Hewlett packard financial services) and systems of scale of ~300 people working with 100's of application used in these process. based on ILO standards. Defining metrics & measuring the metrics that Generating reports to measure the production and efficiency of these processes. I have created value engineering maps identifying value generation using the existing processes and if it was financial process have worked to ensure it meets SOX compliance. 
 
Have collaborated with business process management teams (IT / Training / Finance / Operations /HR) to lead projects that identify the key to process changes and consulting on change control process mechanisms.
 
 My main challenge here was to optimize research work in these processes, which made me to think differently and shift to Information technology as I found to optimize better it is important to know how the background network work which choose me to become a network engineer. 
 
 As I choose to become a network engineer and learn the skills. I choose to teach in Internetworkz what I learnt. Took CCNA, CCNP and CCIE writing exams and as well as work in work in JPMorgan in learning how Cisco Switches and routers work. My Journey to work more on this field lead me to work with CCS Corp-Juniper networks. I have worked to provide Tier1/Tier2 network engineer of all M, MX and T series routers that could be deployed as core, IP edge or as even a switch depending on type of configuration of the router supporting JunosOS and hence gained knowledge of core network , tunneling, authentication, authorisation, accounting, firewall,security, load balancing, VPN, MPLS, SDN, certification authority servers, netowrk module management, Quality of service,url filtering, Network admission control, etc concepts along with grasping how each customer networks backbone architecture work. 
 
 I moved to Ericsson as Tier3 network engineer part of network services, which is the last point of resolution working on Ericsson edge/core network devices providing carrier grade services providing support to major telecoms like Sprint, AT&T, Telefonica, Airtel, Vodafone and many more. Apart from the regular packet core network, supported broadband subscription, Mobile backbone network(4G LTE), LTE-advanced, IPTV and collaborating with OSS/BSS for network monitoring.
